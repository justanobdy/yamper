# Yamper
Yamper (Yet Another Music PlayER) is a simple music player with the following features:

- Nice looking, clean GUI
- Written in C++ using SFML and ImGui
- Built-in Spotify and Youtube downloading (not yet done)

Yamper is currently far from being complete, although work on it is progressing at a decent rate.
# Building
See [Build.md](Build.md)

# TODO

- Use PlaylistManager::Reference and ArtistManager::Reference in the code
- Add Spotify and Youtube downloading (using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [spotify-dl](https://github.com/SathyaBhat/spotify-dl))

# Wishlist

- Move to [TGUI](https://tgui.eu)
